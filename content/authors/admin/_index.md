I am a DPhil (PhD) student in the [Probability Group](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/probability-home) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk). My research focuses on stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), in particular their applications to population modelling. 

Many SPDEs need to be renormalised, that is, to establish their well-posedness or small-noise behaviour, we need to subtract diverging counter-terms. I am interested in how those counter-terms affect the underlying population.

I have previously [studied]({{< relref "/publication/msc_thesis" >}}) how the renormalisation of the parabolic Anderson model affects the birth-death mechanism of an underlying branching Brownian motion. In ongoing joint [work]({{< relref "/publication/preprint" >}}), I investigate the fluctuating hydrodynamics of weakly-interacting Langevin diffusions modelling chemotactically interacting particles.
