abstract: The main goal of this work is to construct the killed rough Super Brownian Motion, a superprocess in a white noise environment first introduced by Perkowksi and Rosati. To achieve this, we use a Branching Brownian Motion and a novel intermediate process called the killed mollified Super Brownian Motion. Not only does this simplify the construction of Rosati et al., it may also be more aligned with biological intuition. In order to show the uniqueness of the killed rough Super Brownian Motion, we construct a solution to the associated Evolution Equation, a certain Singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equation with a logistic non-linearity. This construction is carried out by introducing what we shall call Paracontrolled Wild sums, a lightweight tool which also yields the approximability of solutions and differentiability with respect to a small parameter in the initial condition.

# Description

* Identified an intermediate process, the killed mollified super Brownian motion, in the universality class of N. Perkowski and T. Rosati’s killed rough super Brownian motion [T.C. Rosati, N. Perkowski, *Ann. Probab. 49(2)*, 2021; T.C. Rosati, *Electron. Commun. Probab.* 25, 2020]

* Developed a novel construction of singular stochastic PDEs with multiplicative noise and quadratic reaction terms based on Wild sums
